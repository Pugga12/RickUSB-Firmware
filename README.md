# RickUSB-Firmware (SAMD21/32u4)
RickUSB-Firmware is a firmware for the RickUSB/RickStick Collection of Rickrolling USB devices.

This uses the Keyboard.h library to implement the keyboard functionality, so this project can be used exclusively with SAMD21/32u4 boards.

Only available on Windows with the Run application (preinstalled since Windows 95+)

This software is compatible with the following devices: any SAMD21/32u4 board, but built and maintained for the Adafruit Neo Trinkey M0 board.

NOTE: If using a generic samd21/32u4 board, please remove/comment out references to the Neopixels on the Adafruit Neo Trinkey M0 board.
